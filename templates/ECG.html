    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>Set of 3 Jupyter notebooks that explore electrophysiological concepts and provide some theoretical background of
        electrocardiogram(ECG) signals. Freely accessible data was imported from a database on physionet
        (https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/). The contents are divided into the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basics: Theory and concepts of a healthy EEG signal.
        </li>
        <li>ECG Analysis: Automation of basic analysis and
            exploration of ECG signal. This includes obtaining important par√°meters and values, and relevant marked
            plots.
        </li>
        <li>
            Advanced AI
            ECG analysis: Explained development of an advanced AI architecture to diagnose cardiac arrhythmia. This
            process
            includes the download of open-source marked recordings, database pre-processing, architecture optimization,
            model
            training, and model evaluation. The elaboration of the network was developed step by step and it explained
            how
            to identify
            overfitting and how to correct it. The final accuracy of the algorithm was 81%.
